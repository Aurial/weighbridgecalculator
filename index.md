### Can users see their personal data?

The data stored is: Time and date that the data was saved, the type of vehicle and trailer (number of axles and configuration) that the data relates to, and the numerical data relating to the weights at each axle.  This data is only viewable by the user inside the app by loading the data as it is never transmitted from the device.
